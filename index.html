    <h1>Welcome to Odin’s Cookbook</h1>
    <img src="./images/odins-cookbook-picture.png" width="500" alt="A picture of Odin's Cookbook">
    <h2>Grease-stained pages. Forbidden flavors. Recipes from the edge of the Veil.</h2>
    <p>Hidden behind a rusted grate in the back alleys of the Forgotten Ward, <strong>Odin’s Cookbook</strong> is a collection of cursed cuisine and arcane bar snacks passed down by the exiled warlock himself. These aren’t your grandmother’s recipes—unless she brewed bone broth under a blood moon and served dumplings stuffed with secrets.</p>
    <p>Here, the menu is scrawled in ash and oil. The dishes reek of danger and garlic. Each recipe is a memory of late-night deals, spilled potions, and backroom brawls over the last bite of Void Wings. Whether you’re frying up Goblin Grease Fries or ladling out Lunar Elixirs, you’re casting more than a meal—you’re conjuring part of the Dive.</p>
    <p>So grab your cast iron, whisper a warding spell, and step into the greasy, glowing world of underground magical cuisine. <em>This is food that bites back.</em></p>
